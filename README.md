"Beast beats seller" - a pet project developed by me from scratch, is a marketplace for selling / buying music, as well as for communication between artists and listeners. The project is currently under development.
The site currently has the following features:
- Authorization and personal account.
- Purchase of music and payment using "LiqPay".
- Custom audio player.
- An artist's page where communication with the audience takes place.
- Page for each individual song with sound wave visualization and comments like on "SoundCloud"

The current stable hosted version is available at the [link](https://beast-beats-seller.store/home).

Future features of the site:
- Improved audio player, additional real-time visualization.
- Additional sections on the artist's page.
- Advanced filtering functionality.
- Ability to more flexibly interact with site moderation.
